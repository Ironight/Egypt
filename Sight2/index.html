                        The Abu Simbel temple stands at a height of 30 meters and has a length of 35 meters, 
                        where the front of the temple has four statues of Ramesses II at his throne, to symbolize conquered enemies, the Nubians, Libyans, and Hittites.

                        <br>
                        The story of how Abu Simbel temple gots its name is when a young boy showed a swiss explorer named Burckhardt the site, but when Burckhardt uncovered the site it was buried in sand up to the necks. 
                        But many believed it was another explorer named Belzoni who discovered and named it after the young boy, just because he was the first one who excavated and looted the site.

                        <br>
                        The Abu Simbel temple sits at the west bank of Lake Nasser around 300km from the city Aswan or about 20km from the Sudan border in region Nubia. 
                        There are two ways to get to the temple, like a flight from Cairo to Aswan or a round trip from Aswan.
