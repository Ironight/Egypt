                    If you are invited to the house of a person in this country and you are offered a glass of juice, remember to drink all of the juice to the end. 
                    It is customary that if a guest doesn’t finish their glass of juice that they offered by a host family with daughters, then these girls won’t get married.

                        In this tradition, the guest sings loud songs, and the baby’s parents distributings sweets to the guests. 
                        The singer asks the baby to listen to his/her parents and always be a calm and worthy child.
