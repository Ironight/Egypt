                    Egypt is a place of many delicacies. They are famous for their Kushari, which is a mix of rice, spaghetti and macaroni, topped with a meat based sauce. 
                    Furthermore they have an ancient dish that dates all the way back to the ancient times of egypt. The dish is called Ful Medames and is a starter meal consisting of lava beans. 
                    Sides are often included and can vary. 
                    You can eat Ful Medames with a sallad, pastrami or even eggs.

                        Egyptian mythology 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A common misconception about Egyptian mythology is that they are obsessed with death given the Pyramids and tombs inside of said pyramids, which is far from the truth. 
                        Egyptians believed that the great god Atum created everything with the help of the god of magic Heka. Heka predated the creation itself and is the source of everything.That is only one of the creation stories though. 
                        There are 4 different versions of the story, but all of them have Atum as the creator.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        They believed that one's soul was eternal and that they would rejoin the eternal realm once they died. 
                        The reason that mummies became a prominent part of the Egyptian religion was that they believed that without the preservation of the physical body their soul would not achieve immortality.
